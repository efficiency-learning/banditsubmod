## Paper

**Title**: Bandit-Guided Submodular Curriculum for Adaptive Subset Selection

**Conference**: NeurIPS 2025

**Abstract**: This work presents a novel framework that combines multi-armed bandits with submodular optimization for adaptive data subset selection during deep learning training. Our approach creates an adaptive curriculum that evolves throughout training, achieving significant speedups while maintaining model performance across computer vision and natural language processing tasks.
